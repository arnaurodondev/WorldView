"""Application-layer Pydantic response models for the Path Insights API (PLAN-0074 §9.3, Wave E2).

These models are defined in the application layer so that use cases can return
typed Pydantic models without importing from api/ (LAYER-BOUNDARY rule, R12).

The api/schemas/paths.py module re-exports from here for backward compatibility
with routers.

These models define the public wire format for GET /api/v1/entities/{id}/paths.
They mirror the domain entities in knowledge_graph.domain.entities.path_insight
but are JSON-serialisable and safe to expose over HTTP.

BP-126 / BP-148 guard: every nullable field uses ``= None`` so FastAPI/Pydantic
never raises a validation error when the DB value is absent.
