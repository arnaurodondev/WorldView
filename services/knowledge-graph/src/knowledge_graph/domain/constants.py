"""Domain constants for the knowledge graph (PLAN-0112 W2, T-2-03).

This module owns the *membership* relation-label set used by the
connection-discovery engine (``GraphPathEngine``) and the weirdness scorer.

Why these are plain string constants — NOT ``RelationType`` enum values:

- AGE stores edge labels **uppercased, with spaces→underscores**, derived from
  ``relations.canonical_type`` by ``age_sync_worker._derive_edge_label`` (e.g.
  ``"listed_on"`` → ``"LISTED_ON"``).  The traversal Cypher therefore matches on
  these **uppercase** label strings.
- The ``RelationType`` StrEnum (``domain/enums.py``) is **lowercase** and only
  covers 16 of the relation types.  Several membership relations
  (e.g. ``IS_IN_SECTOR``, ``HEADQUARTERED_IN``) are **not** members of that enum
  at all — they live only in the AGE label space / ``relation_type_registry``.
  So this set MUST be defined as literal AGE-label strings, not derived from
  ``RelationType``.

Membership relations are low-information for "weird connection" discovery: every
company in a sector is ``IS_IN_SECTOR``-connected to thousands of peers, so a
2-hop ``A —IS_IN_SECTOR→ Sector ←IS_IN_SECTOR— B`` path is trivially true and
adds no insight.  Pruning them from the traversal both kills the combinatorial
hub blow-up (BP-689) and removes noise from the weirdness ranking (FR-3).

> **Layer note (R12)**: the domain layer must not import from infrastructure, so
> the ``TRAVERSABLE_RELATIONS`` set (= the AGE whitelist minus these membership
> labels) and the import-time validation that all four membership labels exist
> in that whitelist live in the *infrastructure* AGE engine module
> (``infrastructure/age/graph_path_engine.py``), where importing the AGE-sync
> worker's whitelist is legal.

> **Pruning parity**: the relational hot-path adapter
> (``infrastructure/relational/graph_path_adapter.py``) reuses this SAME
> ``MEMBERSHIP_RELATIONS`` set for its post-hoc membership filter so the AGE and
> relational engines prune identically (PLAN-0113).

# Uppercase AGE edge-label strings (same label space as MEMBERSHIP_RELATIONS).
# For these two relation types ``(A, type, B)`` means exactly the same thing as
# ``(B, type, A)`` — "A partners with B" ⇔ "B partners with A".  All other 30
# active relation types are ASYMMETRIC: reversing subject/object inverts the
# meaning (e.g. ``ACQUIRED_BY``, ``SUPPLIER_OF``, ``SUBSIDIARY_OF``).
#
# Why this matters for traversal rendering (edge-directionality fix, see
# docs/audits/2026-06-13-edge-directionality-investigation.md): the undirected
# VLE traversal can walk an edge BACKWARD relative to its stored direction.  For
# ASYMMETRIC edges the renderer must present the hop in TRUE subject→object order
# (swap the displayed endpoints when the edge was reverse-walked).  For SYMMETRIC
# edges no swap is needed — either orientation reads correctly.
