Runs every `brokerage_sync_cycle_seconds` (default: 4 h).  For each ACTIVE or ERROR

`RecordTransactionUseCase`.

Entry point:

# Per-connection advisory lock helpers. Two worker replicas can otherwise iterate
# the same active ``BrokerageConnection`` concurrently and double-record
# activities before the snapshot upsert at the end of ``_sync_connection``
# stabilises — visible to the user as inflated holdings for 5-60s, or
# permanently if the snapshot fetch fails after the partial replay.
#
# We use ``pg_try_advisory_xact_lock`` (non-blocking, auto-released on
# COMMIT/ROLLBACK) keyed off a deterministic 63-bit int derived from the
# connection UUID. ``hashlib.blake2b`` is used instead of Python's built-in
# ``hash()`` because the latter is randomised per process (PYTHONHASHSEED),
# which would defeat cross-replica coordination.
#
# Scoping: the lock must be held INSIDE the same Postgres transaction that
# performs the writes. The simplest minimal-refactor approach (which preserves
# BP-057's "no SnapTrade calls while a write UoW is open" rule for the
# inner work-UoWs) is to open ONE outermost "lock UoW" at the start of
# ``_sync_connection`` whose only job is to hold the advisory lock for the
# duration of the per-connection sync. The lock UoW is never committed —
# ``__aexit__`` rolls it back which releases the xact-scoped lock cleanly.

        bridge-field branch: post-F2 the canonical UUID lives in S2's
        ``instruments`` table (M-017 invariant: ``canonical_entities.entity_id ==
        instruments.id`` for tradable kinds).

        * S2 returns 200 → return the populated ``InstrumentRef``.
        * S2 returns 404 → raise ``BrokerageSyncSymbolNotFoundError``. The caller
          maps this to a ``SyncErrorType.UNKNOWN_INSTRUMENT`` row and continues.
